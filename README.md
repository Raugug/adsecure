Some considerations :



I haven't validated types in the functions due to they were specific in the instructions.

I am aware I could have done it anyway.

I tested manually the functions but I didn't use unit tests because my time is really limited right now and I'm not really familiar with TDD tools yet. I'll work on it the following days/weeks.

- Find a flat exercise files:
        bestFlats.js - apiService.js - bestflats.json
- I used node.JS:
           node bestFlats.js to run it 

The "algorithm" to choose the best flats is just a dumb sort function. I am aware this is not really useful. I can improve it if necessary.
